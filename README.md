# MilkStats
A mod for Elin that displays the stat and skill bonuses granted to a baby by milk. Note that the baby's base potentials are applied as a percentage to each value. For example, a baby with a Strength base potential of 80 would only get 80% of the displayed Strength milk bonus. (Temporary potential from food or training doesn't apply, only the base potential.)
